counter
=======

Counter is an app I made to learn how to use the Pebble SDK. It's pretty minimalist but can be useful from time to time. My official description reads:

Counter is a multipurpose counting app with applications including card counting, lap tracking, and monitoring chicken wing intake.

It is available at the [Pebble Store](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/52fd881562f8c4f39e000064).
